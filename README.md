# ü©∫ Medical-Projects

Welcome to the **Medical-Projects** repository! This collection is dedicated to various biomedical image processing projects, focusing on **classification**, **localization**, and **segmentation** tasks. Our goal is to replicate and build upon state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in these critical domains, advancing the field of medical imaging through deep learning.

## üìÇ Notebooks Overview

### 1. ü©ª Classification: Swin Transformer on NIH ChestX-ray
**Notebook:** `Classification_Swin_NIH_chestXRay.ipynb`  
**Description:**  
This project leverages a Swin Transformer-based model for the multi-class and multi-label classification of chest X-rays from the NIH ChestX-ray dataset. The model is designed to detect various thoracic diseases by analyzing X-ray images, pushing the boundaries of diagnostic accuracy.

### 2. üéØ Localization: DINO on VinDr Dataset
**Notebook:** `DINO_localization_vindr.ipynb`  
**Description:**  
This notebook employs the DINO (Self-Distillation with No Labels) approach for image localization tasks on the VinDr dataset. The project aims to enhance localization accuracy by using bounding boxes as references for detecting abnormalities in medical images.

### 3. üìä Test Results: Localization Performance Analysis
**Notebook:** `TestResults_Localization.ipynb`  
**Description:**  
This notebook provides detailed test results and evaluation metrics for localization models applied to medical imaging datasets. It includes performance analysis and visualizations, offering insights into model predictions and overall effectiveness.

### 4. üîç Segmentation: Pneumothorax Detection
**Notebook:** `pneumothorax_segmentation.ipynb`  
**Description:**  
Focused on the segmentation of pneumothorax in chest X-ray images, this project utilizes deep learning to detect and precisely segment affected regions. The model is trained and tested on a dataset specifically curated for pneumothorax detection, contributing to more accurate and timely diagnoses.

### 5. üß† 2D & 3D Medical Image Classification: MedMNIST
**Notebook:** `MedMNIST_2D_3D.ipynb`  
**Description:**  
This notebook explores both 2D and 3D medical image classification using the MedMNIST dataset. The project replicates and builds upon SOTA techniques for handling diverse datasets, applying deep learning methods to advance the classification of medical images across different dimensions.
